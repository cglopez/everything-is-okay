# Contributing

* Fork and clone the repo
* There are two ways to contribute. Pick one:
  * Modify `everything-is-okay.json`. From within `app/`, then run `npm run readme`.
  * Modify `README.md`. From within `app/`, then run `npm run json` {1}.
* Commit and push your changes!
* Make the Pull Request

{1} Note: When using `npm run json` the script assumes consistent Markdown syntax, so check `everything-is-okay.json` to see if things built correctly. At worst, one of the contributors will take care of it, so don't worry.
